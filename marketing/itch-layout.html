    <p>
            On your way back home through the solar system, you will encounter countless lifeless obstacles which you must dodge. Using your small arsenal of galactic gardening tools, you can plant life onto these obstacles to calm them and grant you an easier path back home. Dodge everything, and Plant Trees!

        As your mission is to sprout as many trees throughout the galaxy as possible, your ship is equipped with the latest in galactic gardening technologies. You switch between:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
           <h3>(very) Berry Blaster</h3>
           <div class="details">
               With this weapon you get the most seed output per second. As you upgrade the Berry Blaster, the more seeds you produce. At full upgrade you gain two gatling guns spraying seedlings at double the speed!
           </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>'Copter Cannon</h3>
            <div class="details">
                The 'Copter Cannon fires much slower than the Berry Blaster, but can plant on multiple targets and knocks affected targets away from the player. At full upgrade you gain to alternating cannons that fire the largest seed specimens in the galaxy at double speed!
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Protect &amp; Pollinate</h3>
            <div class="details">
                With this weapon activated, your ship is surrounded with a protective aura that will pollinate any targets that get inside the field. It also slows the movement of all targets that enter the field, protecting the ship and giving you time to maneuver through the field of obstacles. Each upgrade to this weapon increases the pollination rate, and aura radius.
            </div>
        </li>
    </ul>

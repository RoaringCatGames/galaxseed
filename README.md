# Post libGDX Jam

After the libGDX jam we have continued work on the game to make it playable, and presentable for publication on the App Stores as a mobile game. We've been using this project as a good way to practice working with [Ashley ECS](https://github.com/libgdx/ashley/wiki) and extracting more common systems into our [Kitten2d Ashley Extensions](https://github.com/RoaringCatGames/kitten2d-ashley-extensions). All of that plus just the experience of finishing, polishing, and releasing a game.

## Louisville Arcade Expo

We showed a version of the game at the [Louisville Arcade Expo](http://www.arcaderx.com/) to get initial feedback. It was a successful event in that it pointed out a ton of areas for improvement in the game. Some of which we were aware of, but plenty we weren't.

## Kentucky Fried Pixels

After the Arcade expo we renamed the game from "Planetary Planter" to "GalaxSeed". Our local game development community [Louisville Makes Games](http://louisvillemakesgames.org/) hosted a game jam called "Kentucky Fried Pixels" which we participated in with GalaxSeed to bring it up to a release-ready state. All of the games from the jam were then polished and placed into a Bundle: [KFP Bundle](https://itch.io/b/122/kentucky-fried-pixels).
